							<h3>What is Ibhuku?</h3>
	        				<p>An ethnic group down in the Southern parts of Africa commonly refers to a book as "Ibhuku". What a familiar name it is in English. This traditional language speaking group of South Africa falls in love with books that they baptise them a name in their language. Who knows when the Zulu came up with this name for a book? A wonder! Join the Zulu in the path of civilization by reading more books. </p>
